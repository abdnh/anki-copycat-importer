<p>This add-on allows you to import decks from copycat apps such as <a href="https://www.ankiapp.com/">AnkiApp</a> and <a href="https://ankipro.net/">AnkiPro</a>.</p>

<b>AnkiApp</b>

<p>It appears that AnkiApp started to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ocbhry/help_to_bypass_ankiapps_paywall_for_deck_export/">paywall the deck export feature</a>.
So you can no longer export a zip of your cards <a href="https://www.ankiapp.com/support/solutions/ddcf01b0/can-i-export-my-flashcards-from-ankiapp-/">without paying</a>.</p>
<p>This add-on salvages the cards from the SQLite database and was inspired by the Reddit post linked above. It can import cards, decks, note types, and media files.</p>

<b>Usage</b>

<ul>
<li>Make sure all your AnkiApp decks are downloaded before using the add-on. For that, go to AnkiApp, click on each of your decks, then click on the Download button at the bottom if it's shown.</li>
<li>Run Anki and go to <i>Tools &gt; Copycat Importer &gt; Import from AnkiApp</i>. The add-on tries to detect AnkiApp's data folder on your system automatically. If you see the "Data folder" field already populated, you can go ahead and click Import. You can also specify a different folder location, or a single SQLite database file by checking the "Database file" option (only recommened if you don't have access to the whole data folder for some reason, as the add-on may need other files in the data folder to properly import notetypes).</li>
</ul>

<b>Notes &amp; Known Issues</b>

<ul>
<li>Study progress is not imported.</li>
<li>AnkiApp doesn't seem to keep any info on the positions of note type fields, so an empty field will cause
Anki to refuse to import its note if it happened to be imported as the first field.
To prevent that, the add-on fills all empty fields with a non-breaking space.</li>
</ul>

<b>AnkiPro</b>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdnh/anki-copycat-importer/ankipro/images/ankipro.png" alt="AnkiPro Importer"></p>

<b>Usage</b>

<p>The add-on works by downloading your decks from the AnkiPro site, so it needs your email and password. Go to <i>Tools &gt; Copycat Importer &gt; Import from AnkiPro</i> and enter your account details.</p>

<b>Notes &amp; Known Issues</b>

<ul>
<li>Importing of <a href="https://ankipro.net/library">library decks</a> is not supported. Since they are simply scraped from AnkiWeb, you can search and download the decks from <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks">AnkiWeb</a> instead.</li>
<li>Importing of study progress and deck options is not supported yet.</li>
</ul>
