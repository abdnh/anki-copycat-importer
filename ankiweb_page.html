This add-on allows you to import decks from the copycat AnkiApp (https://www.ankiapp.com/).
It appears that AnkiApp started to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ocbhry/help_to_bypass_ankiapps_paywall_for_deck_export/">paywall the deck export feature</a>. So you can no longer export a zip of your cards <a href="https://www.ankiapp.com/support/solutions/ddcf01b0/can-i-export-my-flashcards-from-ankiapp-/">without paying</a>.
This add-on salvages the cards from the SQLite database and was inspired by the Reddit post linked above. It can import cards, decks, note types, and media files.

<b>How to Use</b>
<ul><li>Make sure all your AnkiApp decks are downloaded before using the add-on. For that, go to AnkiApp, click on each of your decks, then click on the Download button at the bottom if it's shown.</li><li>Go to <b>Tools > Import From AnkiApp</b> and choose AnkiApp's database file (<code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\AnkiApp\databases\file__0</code> on Windows; <code>~/Library/Application Support/AnkiApp/databases/file__0/1</code> or under <code>~/Library/Containers/com.ankiapp.client/Data/Documents/ankiapp</code> on macOS).</li><li>Grab a cup of coffee while waiting for importing to finish.</li></ul>

<b>Notes & Known Issues</b>
<ul><li>Study progress is not imported.</li><li>AnkiApp doesn't seem to keep any info on the positions of note type fields, so an empty field will cause Anki to refuse to import its note if it happened to be imported as the first field. To prevent that, the add-on fills all empty fields with a non-breaking space.</li></ul>

<b>Changelog</b>
